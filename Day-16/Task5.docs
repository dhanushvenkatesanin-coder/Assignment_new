<JavaScript (JS) has evolved greatly since its creation:
1. *1995 – Birth of JavaScript:*
   Brendan Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days at Netscape to make web pages interactive. It was first called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.
2. *1997 – Standardization (ECMAScript):*
   JavaScript became standardized as ECMAScript (ES) by ECMA International. ES1 was released in 1997, followed by ES2 (1998) and ES3 (1999).
3. *2009 – ES5 Revolution:*
   ES5 introduced JSON support, strict mode, and better object handling. This made JavaScript more stable and widely used.
4. *2015 – ES6 (ECMAScript 2015):*
   A huge upgrade adding let, const, arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules—modern JavaScript began here.
5. *2016–Present – Continuous Growth:*
   New versions (ES7, ES8, etc.) are released yearly with features like `async optional chaining, and modern APIs. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js expanded JS beyond browsers to full-stack development.
6. *Today – Universal Language:*
   JavaScript now powers web, mobile, desktop, and even AI apps—used everywhere from browsers to servers to IoT.
